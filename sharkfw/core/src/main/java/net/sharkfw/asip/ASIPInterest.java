/**
 * <p>An interface defining the kepInterest.</p>
 *
 * <p>An kepInterest in shark is used to describe the context in which a peer is
 * willing to exchange information. The kepInterest thus is a special {@link ContextSpace}.
 * The {@link SemanicTag}s on the different dimensions of the kepInterest define this
 * context.</p>
 *
 * ContextSpace is a general concept whereas kepInterest makes more specific
 * definitions about the communication context. An kepInterest defines seven aspects
 * (constraints) in which a peer is willing to exchange information.
 * 
 * Each aspect can be set. If set, communication takes place if kepInterest
 * have mutual kepInterest. A mutual kepInterest can be calculated by contextualising
 * a kepInterest with another on (see @link CSAlgebra).
 * 
 * Unset aspects are interpreted as no constraints. Anything is allowed.
 * Thus, the most general kepInterest has no aspect set, meaning: any get-methode return
 * nulls. A peer is interested in virtually everything.
 * 
 * Arbitrary combinations are possible. Application can decide just to define 
 * topics but no locations etc. That's quite similiar to Wikipedia. Others could
 * decide to define topics and peer which looks like a social network application.
 * 
 * Using location aspect leads directly to a location based system. Using all
 * aspects leads to a system that combines social network, wikipedia and 
 * location based systems. SharkNet is such a system which is a demonstration
 * of those Shark features.
 * 
 * Interest inherits from AnchorSet. The major difference is in usage of dimensions.
 * AnchorSets only use semantic tags but not their relations. AnchorSets are
 * usually contextualization parameter. An kepInterest is transmitted to other peers.
 * The set in each dimension are not only an enumeration of tags but also
 * their relations - in a taxonomy or a sementic network.
