# shark-demo

A demo of the new capabilities of the Shark framework (Sync and WifiDirect).
When using this, keep in mind it is only a prototype. It is by no means production-ready,
but a good illustration that will hopefully help getting things started when creating
an app that uses those two slightly advanced features.

The code should be documented well enough to make understanding it pretty 
straightforward. If you run into any problems while working with it, feel free
to contact its former maintainers. Have fun!
